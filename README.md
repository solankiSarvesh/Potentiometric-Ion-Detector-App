This app enables real-time detection of potassium, sodium, and pH levels using an Arduino Nano 33 IoT with ion-selective sensors, displaying results on an Android app via Wi-Fi or NFC. It shows sample ID, date, potential, and concentration, along with live voltage-time graphs and health status (Normal, High, Low). Users can view test history, get results by providing name and send results via SMS, and even scan NFC tags for offline accessâ€”making it a complete, portable solution for fast and smart ion analysis.
